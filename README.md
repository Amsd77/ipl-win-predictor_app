## 🧠 Key Features

- End-to-end ML workflow: Data preprocessing → Model training → Web deployment
- Real-time user input to simulate live match scenarios
- Dynamic calculation of features like:
  - Runs left
  - Balls left
  - Wickets remaining
  - Current run rate vs. required run rate

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning
- **Streamlit** for web app interface
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for exploratory analysis (optional)
